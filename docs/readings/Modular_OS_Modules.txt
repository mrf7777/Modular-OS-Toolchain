A Modular OS Module refer to a special virtual directory that meets special requirements.

For a virtual directory named <dir-name>, the following conditions must be met for it to be considered a Module with name <dir-name>.

- It must have a file named “/<dir-name>/.mod-version”. It must have only one line which holds a non-negative integer.
- It must have a file named “/<dir-name>/.mod-dependencies”. It must have an even number of lines. For each pair of lines, the first line specifies a module name, the second line specifies the minimum version required for that module. The file may be empty.

A module <mod-name> must have its dependencies satisfied before it can be used correctly. For this to happen, for each pair of lines in the file “/<mod-name>/.mod-dependencies”, the first line must specify an existing module on the Modular OS filesystem named <dep-name> that also has all of its dependencies satisfied, and the integer on the second line must match the first line of the file “/<dep-name>/.mod-version”.

By its nature, checking if a module has its dependencies satisfied is a recursive action because it must check that its dependencies are also satisfied.
