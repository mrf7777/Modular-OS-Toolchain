asin,1,1,0,0,"Calculates the inverse sine of 1-back, pops once, and pushes result."
acos,1,1,0,0,"Calculates the inverse cosine of 1-back, pops once, and pushes result."
atan,1,1,0,0,"Calculates the inverse tanget of 1-back, pops once, and pushes result."
ln,1,1,0,0,"Calculates the natural logarithm of 1-back, pops once, and pushes result."

and,2,1,0,0,"Remember 1-back and 2-back. Pop twice. If the remembered 1-back and 2-back are non-zero, push 1, 0 otherwise."
or,2,1,0,0,"Remember 1-back and 2-back. Pop twice. If the remembered 1-back or 2-back are non-zero, push 1, 0 otherwise."
not,1,1,0,0,"Remember 1-back. Pop once. If the remembered 1-back is non-zero, push 0, 1 otherwise."
equal,2,1,0,0,"Tests if 1-back and 2-back are equal. Pop twice and push 1 if they are equal, 0 otherwise."
