Each subdirectory here has two text files: a source code file and its compiled then encoded version.

How to Load a Program into Modular OS as a File:

-import the compiled, encoded version into the file stage.
-rename the variable "file stage name" to the desired filename.
-execute the block filesystem.stage_to_filesystem
	-this will create, or clear, a file with the name set in the variable "file stage name" and fill
	   it with the decoded contents.

..and you are done.
